## OOP

## Object
- collection of properties and methods
- can be used to represent real world objects

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript is a way to structure and organize code by creating objects, which represent real-world entities. It allows you to group related data (properties) and behaviors (methods) together.

In OOP, there are key concepts:

1. **Objects**: Containers for data and functions. Example: a "car" object can have properties like `color` and `model`, and methods like `start()` or `drive()`.

2. **Classes**: Blueprints for creating objects. A class defines the structure, and from it, you can create multiple objects with the same properties and methods.

3. **Inheritance**: Allows one class to inherit properties and methods from another, so you can reuse code. Example: A `Truck` class can inherit from a `Vehicle` class.

4. **Encapsulation**: Hiding the details of how something works inside an object, exposing only what's necessary. This makes code easier to manage.

5. **Polymorphism**: Allows different classes to define the same method but with different behaviors. 

OOP makes your code more organized, reusable, and easier to maintain.
