## Introduction

This repository contains the code and notes from my journey of learning JavaScript. I have structured the content to cover various topics from basics to advanced concepts. Each section is aimed at reinforcing my knowledge and applying what I have learned in practical scenarios.

## Learning Goals

- **Master the basics:** Understand JavaScript syntax, variables, loops, and functions.
- **Work with DOM:** Manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) using JavaScript.
- **Learn ES6+ Features:** Dive into modern JavaScript features like arrow functions, promises, async/await, etc.
- **Build Projects:** Apply JavaScript knowledge to create small to medium-sized projects.
- **Understand Asynchronous JavaScript:** Grasp the concepts of callbacks, promises, and async/await.
- **Explore JavaScript Frameworks:** Get introduced to popular frameworks like Angular or React.

## Structure of the Repository

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- **/basics/** - Core concepts and fundamentals of JavaScript.
- **/dom-manipulation/** - Working with the DOM.
- **/es6/** - Modern JavaScript features.
- **/projects/** - Hands-on projects built during the learning process.
- **/asynchronous-js/** - Asynchronous programming in JavaScript.
- **/frameworks/** - Introduction to popular JavaScript frameworks (optional).

Each directory contains relevant code snippets, examples, and exercises that demonstrate the concepts being learned.

## Resources

Throughout my learning journey, I have used various resources such as:

- [MDN Web Docs - JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- [JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info/)
- [Chai aur Code](https://www.youtube.com/@chaiaurcode)
- [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/)


These resources have been instrumental in helping me understand and apply JavaScript concepts.
